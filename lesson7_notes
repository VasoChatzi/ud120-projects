target = slope * input + intercept

error = actual net worth - predicted net worth

Minimizing the sum of squared errors

Algorithms
- Ordinary Least Squares
- Gradient Descent


r^2 metric : how much of my change in y can be explained by a change in x.
0 <= r^2 <= 1
Small r^2 is worse fit

Multi-variate regression
